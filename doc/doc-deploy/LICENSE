Since our application only links dynamically against those LGPL licensed libraries it does not count as "derived work".

The libraries are distributed as a separate package. This package is needed only in case that not all libraries are available on the target platform (or not in the required version).

Note that both GPL and LGPL documents are both available in the same directory as this file.
