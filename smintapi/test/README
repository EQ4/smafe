- How To:  
-------
to test the server setup the api on your web server, 

1) configure 
- test/test.ini 

2) run the tests
- cd test
- phpunit 


NOTE: These tests use the live-database and leave it dirty! So do not invoke the phpunit tests on a non-empty database!

some test depend on PHPUNIT see http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html for installation details. current Version of PHPUNIT required: 3.4
some test depend on cURL see for installation details: http://www.php.net/manual/en/curl.installation.php
curl installation on Ubuntu (> 10.04):  sudo apt-get install curl php5-curl


-------
- CURRENT ISSUES:
-------

- AddUrlTest fails because of Smafe API semantic change.
- ...
- "Advanced tests" are not executed since orchestration with daemons is difficult and/or impossible.

- FAQ: 
-------

- phpunit is not working -> check if version of phpunit is high enough !

- curl not found -> Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install curl php5-curl

- exception test.log can't be opened for writing -> the test log needs to have write access for current user ! 

- exception api.log can't be opened for writing -> the test log needs to have write access for current user ! 

- exception wrong user -> might not be directly related to the test, since the api does not support users (yet). check config/smintapi.ini
